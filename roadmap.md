* As a user, I want to have a limit on a global count for the time on all the sites that I consider distraction.
* As a user, I want the possibility to block a site for a period of time after having been on it for a certain time (for example, a thiry minutes on youtube, I want it to be blocked for two hours before I can use it for thirty minutes again).
* As a user, I want to have a hard restriction for certain hours.
* As a user, I want to choose different restrictions according to certain days (weekdays, weekends, weekdays excepted wednesdays, etc.)
* As a user, I want to have a way to hide potentially embarassing limits (private browsing, for example).
* As a user, I want to be able to see the evolution in my usage and get it as a pdf or an md file.
